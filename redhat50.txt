Subject: Redhat 5.0 Linux Makefile.PL for PostgresPerl-1.3
Date: Wed, 11 Feb 1998 01:29:13 -0600

Vivek,

Here is a modified Makefile.PL for PostgresPerl-1.3 to allow it to work
on RedHat Linux 5.0 distribution. It works on my RH5 i386 machine. If
you wish, please distribute it with the PostgresPerl-1.3 package.
-----cut below here
use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
# See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
# the contents of the Makefile that is written.
# Modified for Redhat 5.0, this file is named RH5Makefile.PL
WriteMakefile(
    'NAME'	=> 'Postgres',
    'VERSION_FROM' => 'Postgres.pm', # finds $VERSION
    'LIBS'	=> ['-L/var/lib/pgsql -lpq'],
    'DEFINE'	=> '',     # e.g., '-DHAVE_SOMETHING' 
    'INC'	=> '-I/usr/include/pgsql',
    'MYEXTLIB' 	=> ' /usr/lib/libpq.so.1',
);
<----end of file

Thanks for your work.
