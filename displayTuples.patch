Subject: About PostgresPerl-1.3


Hi there,

	First of all, thanks alot for the perl module.  I have Perl 5.003
    and Postgres95 1.09 on a linux machine, and everything seems to work
    fine.  I will soon be trying it on SunOS and Solaris 2.5 servers.

	I am bit surprised though that you didn't include an interface to
    any of libpq-fe.h's print functions, such as displayTuples.  So I added
    that.  Here is the code that I added to your Postgres.xs file:

void
query_printresults(q, fp, fieldSep)
        QUERY *q;
        FILE  *fp;
        char  *fieldSep;
    PROTOTYPE: $$$
    CODE:
        PQdisplayTuples(q->res, fp, 1, fieldSep, 1, 1);


Cheers,
